Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The owner of DriverPass wants to create a website focused on training new drivers. He believes that many students are failing their driving tests because 
they aren’t getting the proper training. The client, who owns DriverPass, wants a system where student drivers can register for driving courses. The website should 
allow users to create their own accounts and choose the driving packages they’re interested in. Students will be able to take online training, complete online exams, 
and then schedule on-the-road training. The owner will also have access to all student and employee accounts within the system.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like what I did well on this assignment is my UML diagrams. From the feedback, they are all exceptionally clear, insightful, and straightforward. Also I 
implemented proper UML notation and tools for the different types of diagrams we learned about this term. Also, the presentation was clear, concise, and well
organized. Having a well organized and clear presentation can help our audience learn more about what we are providing for them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would concentrate on developing the functional and non-functional requirements since they play a vital role in the project. Because projects tend to evolve, 
these requirements are rarely ever final. My aim would be to make them more consistent and less prone to frequent changes. To achieve this, I would collect feedback 
from students, employees, and clients who use the software, as their insights are often the most useful for improvement.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I wanted to make sure I thoroughly analyzed all the requirements that were assigned to us. I separated the requirements for the client, students, owner, 
and employees to make them easier to organize and understand. The client’s requirements are particularly crucial because, without clear and accurate requirements, 
the project wouldn’t serve its purpose. In short, the project couldn’t be completed successfully without well-defined requirements.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing the software, I would start by gathering the requirements for the new system functionalities. After that, I would design the system and 
incorporate the new features. Next, I would collect feedback to analyze how well the system meets expectations. Once I have that feedback, I would review the system’s 
constraints and then make any necessary fixes or adjustments to improve its performance.
